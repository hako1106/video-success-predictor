# Video Success Predictor

**Video Success Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict the success of TikTok videos based on various features and engagement metrics. By analyzing data such as views, likes, duration, and more, the model aims to classify videos into categories like "Successful" or "Not Successful," assisting content creators and marketers in optimizing their content strategies.

## Project Structure

- `data_tiktok/`: Contains raw data collected from TikTok.
- `preprocessed_data/`: Holds cleaned and processed data ready for model training.
- `train_data/`: Includes datasets used for training the machine learning models.
- `mlp_classifier/`: Contains the implementation of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model building and evaluation.
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: Data visualization.

## Prediction Results

The model is trained to classify videos into various success categories based on features such as views, likes, duration, etc. The prediction results will be saved in the `results/` directory.
